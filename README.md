Hi! This is my mini 'Guess Who?' game, Harry Potter-style, using React.js and an external API(https://hp-api.onrender.com/).

## Running the project:

## Aspirations for this project:
This project is no way near finished and there are a few things I would like to improve on/add:

3. Use React Router for easier navigation.
